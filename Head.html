	<p> One prominent example of head-worn wearable technology is smart glasses. Smart glasses typically feature a display or projection system integrated into eyewear frames, allowing users to view information or graphics directly in their field of vision. These glasses can provide hands-free access to notifications, navigation, or even virtual and augmented reality experiences. <br> 
		Another type of head-worn wearable technology is smart helmets. These helmets are equipped with sensors, communication systems, and sometimes even built-in displays. They are commonly used in sports, industrial work environments, or for specific purposes such as virtual cycling or motorcycling. Smart helmets can provide real-time data, such as speed, distance, heart rate, or even video recording capabilities. <br>
		Additionally, there are headsets designed specifically for virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) experiences. VR headsets completely immerse users in virtual environments, blocking out the real world. AR headsets, on the other hand, overlay digital information onto the user's real-world view. Both types of headsets offer unique opportunities for gaming, training, education, and various other applications.<p/>
